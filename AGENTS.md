# Development Rules

## Conversational Style

- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")
- Technical prose only, be direct
- When the user asks a question, answer it first before making edits or running implementation commands.
- When responding to user feedback or an analysis, explicitly say whether you agree or disagree before saying what you changed.

## Code Quality

- Read files in full before wide-ranging changes, before editing files you have not fully inspected, and when asked to investigate or audit. Do not rely on search snippets for broad changes.
- No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Inline single-line helpers that have only one call site.
- Check node_modules for external API types; don't guess.
- **No inline imports** (`await import()`, `import("pkg").Type`, dynamic type imports). Top-level imports only.
- Never remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated deps; upgrade the dep instead.
- Use only erasable TypeScript syntax (Node strip-only mode) in code checked by the root config (`packages/*/src`, `packages/*/test`, `packages/coding-agent/examples`): no parameter properties, `enum`, `namespace`/`module`, `import =`, `export =`, or other constructs needing JS emit. Use explicit fields with constructor assignments.
- Always ask before removing functionality or code that appears intentional.
- Do not preserve backward compatibility unless the user asks for it.
- Never hardcode key checks (e.g. `matchesKey(keyData, "ctrl+x")`). Add defaults to `DEFAULT_EDITOR_KEYBINDINGS` or `DEFAULT_APP_KEYBINDINGS` so they stay configurable.
- Never modify `packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts` directly; update `packages/ai/scripts/generate-models.ts` instead, then regenerate. Including the resulting `models.generated.ts` diff is always OK, even if regeneration includes unrelated upstream model metadata changes.

## Commands

- After code changes (not docs): `npm run check` (full output, no tail). Fix all errors, warnings, and infos before committing. Does not run tests.
- Never run `npm run build` or `npm test` unless requested by the user.
- Never run the full vitest suite directly: it includes e2e tests that activate when endpoint/auth env vars are present. For all non-e2e tests, run `./test.sh` from the repo root. Otherwise run specific tests from the package root: `node ../../node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js --run test/specific.test.ts`.
- If you create or modify a test file, run it and iterate on test or implementation until it passes.
- For `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/`, use `test/suite/harness.ts` + the faux provider. No real provider APIs, keys, or paid tokens.
- Put issue-specific regressions under `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/` named `<issue-number>-<short-slug>.test.ts`.
- For ad-hoc scripts, `write` them to a temp file (e.g. `/tmp`), run, edit if needed, remove when done. Don't embed multi-line scripts in `bash` commands.
- Never commit unless the user asks.
- After each user-requested fix, bump the lockstep patch version, commit only the session's files, and push `main` to `origin` after validation.

## Dependency and Install Security

- Treat npm dep and lockfile changes as reviewed code. Direct external deps stay pinned to exact versions.
- Hydrate/update locally with `npm install --ignore-scripts`; clean/CI-style with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. Don't run lifecycle scripts unless the user asks.
- If dep metadata changes, refresh `package-lock.json` with `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`.
- If `packages/coding-agent/npm-shrinkwrap.json` needs regen, run `node scripts/generate-coding-agent-shrinkwrap.mjs` (verify with `--check` or `npm run check`). New deps with lifecycle scripts require review and an explicit allowlist entry in that script; never add one silently.
- Pre-commit blocks lockfile commits unless `CODEIFY_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1`. Don't bypass unless the user wants the lockfile change committed.

## Git

Multiple Codeify sessions may be running in this cwd at the same time, each modifying different files. Git operations that touch unstaged, staged, or untracked files outside your own changes will stomp on other sessions' work. Follow these rules:

Committing:

- Only commit files YOU changed in THIS session.
- Stage explicit paths (`git add <path1> <path2>`); never `git add -A` / `git add .`.
- Before committing, run `git status` and verify you are only staging your files.
- `packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts` may always be included alongside your files.
- Message format: `{feat,fix,docs}[(ai,tui,agent,coding-agent)]: <commit message> (optionally multiple lines)`. Message is informative and concise.

Never run (destroys other agents' work or bypasses checks):

- `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -fd`, `git stash`, `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git commit --no-verify`.

If rebase conflicts occur:

- Resolve conflicts only in files you modified.
- If a conflict is in a file you did not modify, abort and ask the user.
- Never force push.

## Maintainer Workflow

This repository is public for source visibility but maintained privately. Do not solicit, prepare, or process public contributions, issues, or pull requests unless the user explicitly asks.

## Testing Codeify Interactive Mode with tmux

Run the TUI in a controlled terminal (from the repo root):

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s codeify-test -x 80 -y 24
tmux send-keys -t codeify-test "./codeify-test.sh" Enter
sleep 3 && tmux capture-pane -t codeify-test -p
tmux send-keys -t codeify-test "your prompt here" Enter
tmux send-keys -t codeify-test Escape
tmux kill-session -t codeify-test
```

## Changelog

Location: `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` (one per package).

Sections under `## [Unreleased]`: `### Breaking Changes` (API changes requiring migration), `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`.

Rules:

- All new entries go under `## [Unreleased]`. Read the full section first and append to existing subsections; never duplicate them.
- Released version sections (e.g. `## [0.12.2]`) are immutable; never modify them.

## Releasing

**Lockstep versioning**: all packages share one version; every release updates all together. `patch` = fixes + additions, `minor` = breaking changes. No major releases.

1. **Update CHANGELOGs**: ask the user whether they ran the `/cl` prompt on the latest commit on `main`. If not, they must run `/cl` first to audit and update each package's `[Unreleased]` section before releasing.

2. **Local smoke test**: build an unpublished release and smoke test from outside the repo (so it can't resolve workspace files):
   ```bash
   npm run release:local -- --out /tmp/codeify-local-release --force
   cd /tmp

   # Node package install smoke tests
   /tmp/codeify-local-release/node/codeify --help
   /tmp/codeify-local-release/node/codeify --version
   /tmp/codeify-local-release/node/codeify --list-models
   /tmp/codeify-local-release/node/codeify -p "Say exactly: ok"
   /tmp/codeify-local-release/node/codeify

   # Bun binary smoke tests
   /tmp/codeify-local-release/bun/codeify --help
   /tmp/codeify-local-release/bun/codeify --version
   /tmp/codeify-local-release/bun/codeify --list-models
   /tmp/codeify-local-release/bun/codeify -p "Say exactly: ok"
   /tmp/codeify-local-release/bun/codeify
   ```
   Verify both Node and Bun startup, model/account listing, interactive startup, and at least one real prompt with the intended default provider. The bare commands `/tmp/codeify-local-release/node/codeify` and `/tmp/codeify-local-release/bun/codeify` start interactive mode; run each in tmux, submit a prompt, and wait for the model reply before considering the interactive smoke test passed. Failures are release blockers unless the user explicitly accepts the risk.

3. **Run the release script**:
   ```bash
   CODEIFY_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1 npm_config_min_release_age=0 npm run release:patch    # fixes + additions
   CODEIFY_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1 npm_config_min_release_age=0 npm run release:minor    # breaking changes
   ```
   Use `npm_config_min_release_age=0` only for the release command. The repo's normal npm age gate can otherwise block the release lockfile refresh when the current workspace package version was published recently. Review any lockfile or shrinkwrap diffs the release creates before push.

   The release script bumps all package versions, updates changelogs, regenerates release artifacts, runs `npm run check`, commits `Release vX.Y.Z`, tags `vX.Y.Z`, adds fresh `## [Unreleased]` changelog sections, commits `Add [Unreleased] section for next cycle`, then pushes `main` and the tag. Do not rerun the release script after a tag was pushed.

4. **CI publishes npm packages**: pushing the `vX.Y.Z` tag triggers `.github/workflows/build-binaries.yml`. The `publish-npm` job uses npm trusted publishing through GitHub Actions OIDC with environment `npm-publish`; no local `npm publish`, `npm whoami`, OTP, or WebAuthn flow is required.

5. **If CI publish fails**: inspect the failed `publish-npm` job. The publish helper is idempotent and skips package versions already present on npm, so rerun the tag workflow after fixing CI or transient npm issues. Do not rerun `npm run release:patch` or `npm run release:minor` for the same version.

## User Override

If the user's instructions conflict with any rule in this document, ask for explicit confirmation before overriding. Only then execute their instructions.
